# Adverse Event Risk Analysis
## Overview
This project involves extracting and analyzing FDA Adverse Event (AE) reports to identify patterns and predict which demographics are more at risk of experiencing severe 
adverse events. The goal is to develop a data pipeline for ongoing analysis, utilizing machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), 
and other methods to predict the likelihood of adverse events and uncover insights about at-risk populations.

## Project Status  
- Data Extraction: Successfully extracted 6,000 FDA Adverse Event reports via an API
- Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: Currently in progress. This includes handling missing data, normalizing values, and feature engineering to ensure the dataset is ready for modeling
- Future Steps: Once the data is cleaned and preprocessed, I will apply multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, kNN, and others, to predict the likelihood of adverse events and identify demographics at higher risk

## Technologies Used  
- Python: For data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
  - Libraries: pandas, requests, ast
- SQL: for data cleaning, transformation, and querying
- SQL Server: For data storage
